If $f$ is bijective, then, for each $y \\in Y$, there is precisely one $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Therefore, we can construct a unique **inverse function** $f^{-1}:Y \\to X$ such that $f^{-1}(y) = x$ whenever $f(x) = y$. In light of this, we call a bijective $f$ an **invertible function**.\n",
